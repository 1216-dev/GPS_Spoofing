# Spoofing
# üö® GNSS Spoofing Detection Dashboard

An interactive tool to detect GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) spoofing threats by analyzing real satellite data for anomalies such as inconsistent geometry, abnormal position shifts, and unhealthy satellites.

## üîç Features

- Real-time spoofing probability estimation based on:
  - PDOP anomalies
  - Position jumps
  - Satellite health status
- Interactive dashboard with views for:
  - Satellites tracked
  - Position logs
  - Signal metrics
  - Epoch-wise anomalies
- Flagged spoofing events with timestamp and breakdown

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Georinex)
- Streamlit for the interactive UI
- RINEX `.obs` and `.nav` file parser
- Custom anomaly detection logic

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1216-dev/GPS_Spoofing.git
   cd GPS_Spoofing
